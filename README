cd to each of distel, cedit, ecb
and make each of them.
ecb has a problem of hardcoded path in Makefile that you will have to change 
CEDET=~/.emacs.d/packages/cedit
i intend to create a script to do the make for you.


If you dont want a particular mode just comment with a semicolon colon (;;) a load from init.el
Haml mode depends on haml gem to be installed
sudo gem install haml 

create following in your home folder.

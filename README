This emacs configuration assumes that you are using Aquamacs. Aquamacs comes preinstalled with most emacs addons hence lesser pain of configuration

SLIME for LISP has a seperate installer and can be installed from http://braeburn.aquamacs.org/plugins/Aquamacs-SLIME-2009-07-23.pkg.tgz


irfn@firefly ~/dev/elisp >git clone git://github.com/irfn/emacs.git
irfn@firefly ~ >ln -s dev/elisp/emacs .emacs.d
irfn@firefly ~ >cat  ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs\ Emacs/Preferences.el
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")

irfn@firefly ~ >cd .emacs.d
irfn@firefly ~/.emacs.d >./update
this will init all the submodules and update them 

irfn@firefly ~/.emacs.d(master) >cd packages
cd to each of distel, cedit, ecb
and make each of them.
ecb has a problem of hardcoded path in Makefile that you will have to change 
CEDET=~/.emacs.d/packages/cedit
i intend to create a script to do the make for you.


If you dont want a particular mode just comment with a semicolon colon (;;) a load from init.el
Haml mode depends on haml gem to be installed
sudo gem install haml 

create following in your home folder.
create a .snippets directory - mine is symlinked to a folder where i collect snippets
github has a bunch of repositories for yasnippets.
create a .clojure directory  with a blank user.clj files

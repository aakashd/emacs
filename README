This setup has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and emacs 23.1.1
Make sure you have following packages installed.
---
aakash@aakash-ubuntu ~/dev/elisp >git clone git://github.com/aakashd/emacs.git
aakash@aakash-ubuntu ~ >ln -s dev/elisp/emacs .emacs.d
---
If you dont want a particular mode just comment with a semicolon colon (;;) a load from init.el
Haml mode depends on haml gem to be installed
sudo gem install haml 
---
create following in your home folder.
create a .snippets directory - mine is symlinked to a folder where i collect snippets
github has a bunch of repositories for yasnippets.
---
aakash@aakash-ubuntu:~$ cd .emacs.d
aakash@aakash-ubuntu:~/.emacs.d$ ./install.sh
---
Currently there is some issue with DVC and it does not compile with rest of the modes. Execute the following command to complete setup.

aakash@aakash-ubuntu:~/.emacs.d/packages/dvc$ make clean && autoconf && ./configure && make && sudo make install

But still the setup is not stable and it tries to use methods which have been obsoleted and removed from emacs long back.
Thus it has been commented.
---
this will init all the submodules and update them 
and make all the packages
